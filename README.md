## Chrome Extension with different JS injection techniques

This is a WORKING chrome extension which demonstrates a few different JavaScript injection techniques. It is designed to let you basically just copy+paste your code into the appropriate section with very little manual manipulation necessary.

### Setup

1. Clone or download/extract project
2. Visit chrome://extensions
3. Toggle developer mode in top-right
4. Click "Load Unpacked", browse to project and open manifest.json.

### Why?

It took me much longer than needed to merely inject some javascript into some websites. I did find plenty of examples and documentation online, but all of it was either incomplete, incorrect, or outdated and so on.

The purpose of this is to be able to quickly and easily merely comment the methods not needed and add paste your javascript code right in.
